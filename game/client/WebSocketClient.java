/**
 * This is an example of a WebSocket client.
 * <p>
 * In order to run this example you need a compatible WebSocket server.
 * Therefore you can either start the WebSocket server from the examples
 * by running {@link io.netty.example.http.websocketx.server.WebSocketServer}
 * or connect to an existing WebSocket server such as
 * <a href="http://www.websocket.org/echo.html">ws://echo.websocket.org</a>.
 * <p>
 * The client will attempt to connect to the URI passed to it as the first argument.
 * You don't have to specify any arguments if you want to connect to the example WebSocket server,
 * as this is the default.
